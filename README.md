# Project Name:- Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
The objective of this project is to identify major customer segments of a online retail store using the unsupervised machine learning.


## Problem Statement

In this project, our task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## Data Preprocessing: 

1. Importing libraries
2. Importing datasets
3. Finding Missing Data
4. Data Wrangling

## Exploratory data analysis(EDA) :

1. Bar plot of top five customer who has ordered maximum quantity

2. Bar plot of top 5 product customers are ordering repeatedly

3. Bar plot of top 5 product people are cancelling repeatedly

4. Bar plot of top 5 stock code are in high demand

5. Monthy ordered quantity in the year 2010 and 2011

6. Busiest Day of the Week (Bivariate)
7. Busiest month of the Year (Bivariate)
8. Line Maker plot considering the quantities sold with respect to the InvoiceDate (Bivariate)
9. Most Frequent Customers considering the customerID and number of unique InvoiceNo(Bivariate) that is generated for particular customer ID
10. Highest number of Quantities Purchased by top 5 Countries (Bivariate)
11. Busiest Hours considering the Quantities Sold
12. Distribution Plot for the Numerical Columns
13. Line plot to show variaton of ordered and cancelled quantity aacross each month of year 2011.(Multivariate)
14. Correlation between features
15. Pairplot

## Hypothesis Testing
1. T-Test (ttest_ind)

## Feature Engineering & Data Pre-processing

1. Null value treatment
2. Outlier treatment
3. Feature manipulation and Feature Selection
4. Data transformation
5. Data scaling

## Unupervised Machine learning algorithms implementation

1. K-means Clustering considering Silhoutte score
2. K-means Clustering considering elbow method
3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
4. Hierarchical Clustering
